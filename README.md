##  Verification UML Contradiction ##
		Hello! It is project about verifying contradiction that may occur in UML(2.0 version) project.
	We decided to work with 4 types of diagrams : Class, Object, Sequence, State Machine.

		...model - contains JavaBean's that represents our 4 diagram.  
		........class - 
		........object -

		........statemachine
		...converter.xmi - package that will contains converter from XMI format to our model.
